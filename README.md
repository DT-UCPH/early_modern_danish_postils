# Early Modern Danish Postils
This repository contains raw data for a growing collection of postils from Early Modern Denmark

## Niels Hemmingsen (1513-1600)
Published in Latin in 1561 and in Danish translation in 1576 by Rasmus Hansen Reravius
The corpus includes only the text body. Text recognition is performed using the model developed for Brochmand's Sabbati Sanctificatio Winter Part. There are a few recognizable weak points (o-Ã¸; i-l; s-f; t-k-i; v-b), and it will likely be updated once a better model has been developed.

## Christoph Fischer (1519-1598)
Published in 1616 in Danish translated from German by Anna Krabbe.
The corpus includes only the text body. Text recognition is performed using the model developed for Brochmand's Sabbati Sanctificatio Winter Part.

## Jesper Rasmussen Brochmand (1585-1652)
Published in a summer and winter part in 1635 and 1638.
The corpus includes text from header, footer, and marginalia in addition to text body. It is possible that it will be replaced with a new version that excludes header, footer, and marginalia to reduce noice, but until the process can be automatized, it will be impossible to make updates to the text, once it has been implemented.
