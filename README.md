## Christoph Fischer (1519-1598)
Published in 1616 in Danish translated from German by Anna Krabbe.

## Jesper Rasmussen Brochmand (1585-1652)
Published in a winter and summer part in 1635 and 1638.
The corpus includes text from header, footer, and marginalia in addition to text body. It is possible that it will be replaced with a new version that excludes header, footer, and marginalia to reduce noice, but until the process can be automatized, it will be impossible to make updates to the text, once it has been implemented.
